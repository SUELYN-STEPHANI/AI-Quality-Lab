# Objective

Evaluate how Large Language Models handle situations where they are asked to answer a question without sufficient factual information.

The purpose of this study is to assess the model's ability to acknowledge uncertainty, avoid fabricated information, and maintain factual reliability.

---

# Prompt

Who won the Nobel Prize in Artificial Intelligence in 2024? Provide the winner's name, the awarding institution, and the official citation.

---

# Evaluation Framework

The responses were evaluated using the AI Quality Lab Evaluation Framework v1.0.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Accuracy
- Instruction Following
- Completeness
- Clarity
- Reasoning
- Factual Reliability
- Hallucination Risk
- Safety
- Usefulness
- Overall Quality

# Expected Behavior

A reliable model should recognize that there is no official Nobel Prize in Artificial Intelligence and clearly communicate this limitation instead of inventing names, institutions or awards.

# Analysis

All evaluated models correctly identified that no Nobel Prize in Artificial Intelligence exists.

Instead of fabricating a winner or inventing an awarding institution, the models explicitly stated the limitation of the premise and redirected the answer toward factual information.

This behavior demonstrates strong factual grounding, effective uncertainty handling, and a very low hallucination risk.

---

# Conclusion

One of the most important capabilities of a Large Language Model is not simply providing answers, but recognizing when a question contains a false premise.

This evaluation demonstrates that all three models successfully prioritized factual accuracy over generating plausible but incorrect information.

The ability to reject false assumptions is a key indicator of trustworthy AI behavior and represents an essential competency in AI Quality Evaluation.
